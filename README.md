- 👋 Hi, I’m @ItsDinok
- 👀 I’m interested in the overlap between machine learning and cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently completing a computer science research masters
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any useful projects!

About me:

I am a PhD candidate, DJ, Researcher, Musician, and avid cat enjoyer who often dabbles in systems programming and general tool development. Whilst I work and study with computers, you will find most of the code here is about personal projects that have let me learn and express myself.

Enjoy scrolling my projects <3.
